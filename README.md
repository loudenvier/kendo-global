Kendo Global
============

Complements Telerik's Kendo UI with language packs for the localization of all 
Kendo UI widgets. It works with both open source and commercial versions of Kendo UI.

Kendo UI
========

Kendo UI is a fantastic HTML 5 framework and component suite for developing 
cross-browser/device applications. It's based on the JavaScript language and has
helpers for ASP.NET MVC to make the life easier for .NET developers used to the
award winning offerings from Telerik for .NET.

Unfortunately Kendo UI widgets are provided without any form of localization,
except for culture-based number and date formats, so all widgets are rendered 
in plain, good, old English.

Enter Kendo Global...

How
===

Simply add a reference to the desired language file after including the Kendo UI
JavaScript files and all widgets will assume that file's language. Something
like this: 

    <script src="http://cdn.kendostatic.com/2012.3.1114/js/kendo.all.min.js"></script>
    <script src="\js\lang\kendo.ptBR.js"></script>
    
**Note**: The JS files are encoded in UTF-8 so your page should also be enconded
in a compatible charset or else the special characters will look as garbage.
The demos set the correct charset as shown bellow:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8"> 
        ...   

Why
===

Kendo UI widgets use "enclosured" options inside the source code to define the 
many text messages and labels that will be used to render their parts. These 
options aren't available in the global context for easy overriding. These options
can be passed on a per-widget manner to change the texts used for that specific 
widget. This soon becomes cumbersome as every and each widget will require 
a whole set of textual options to show them in a specific language (not to 
mention when you have to show them in multiple languages!) as shown bellow:

    filterable: {
        messages: {
            info: "Título:", 
            filter: "Filtrar", 
            clear: "Limpar", 
            isTrue: "é verdadeiro", 
            isFalse: "é falso", 
            and: "E",
            or: "Ou"
        },
        operators: {
            string: {
                eq: "Igual a",
                neq: "Diferente de",
                startswith: "Começa com",
                contains: "Contém",
                endswith: "Termina em"
            },
            number: {
                eq: "Igual a",
                neq: "Diferente de",
                gte: "Maior que ou igual a",
                gt: "Mair que",
                lte: "Menor que ou igual a",
                lt: "Menor que"
            },
            date: {
                eq: "Igual a",
                neq: "Diferente de",
                gte: "Maior que ou igual a",
                gt: "Mair que",
                lte: "Menor que ou igual a",
                lt: "Menor que"
            }
        }
    },
    groupable: {
        messages: {
          empty: "Arraste colunas aqui para agrupar pelas mesmas"
    }
    ...

The solution employed by Kendo Global is to capitalize on JavaScript nature and 
override these options at the prototype level, without breaking any 
functionality and still allowing individual overrides for specific messages or
labels with the standard mechanism of passing individual options.      

Contributions are welcome
=========================

Currently there are 14 language packs (and growing). I'll accept any and 
all pull requests for corrections and new languages (and also email submissions)

Translating a language file is a trivial (but tedious) process. The file format
is self-explanatory (but don't change anything outside comments and string 
values as the file is a JavaScript executable file and will likely brake if 
changes are made to its "code part"). 

To get started just open any of the files and save a copy of it named after the 
desired language's 2 or 4 character code and start translating it! 

Full credits to each and everyone that contributes will be given individually
bellow!
